Working with VPNs

This task will be done using a free VPN that can be found online and seeing how it masks the IP and to see if the connection is really encrypted. The VPN being used is known as "TunnelBear" which is made in such a way that it is relatively easy to use. Some tools
that will also be used are the websites "https://whatismyipaddress.com/" and "https://browserleaks.com/dns". This will help in understanding if the intial public facing IP is changed and if their is a leak in VPN tunnel.
